Code for shift register testing.
Last code are in PruebaSR3 folder.
In CreoQueEstaSiPruebaSR3 you are able to find two ".c" files of the code we curently are working on improving to finally make it work. Both are similar but slightly changes, PruebaSRNada.c is the last modified.
Could not make it work properly.

To improve:
- Clearness of code storage
- Use of english for names
- Link from initial README.md file to the different versions and results
- Definitions of files
